# Marketing Campaign Performance Dashboard  

## 1. 🟦 Overview  
This project analyzes customer response data from a marketing campaign to evaluate performance across demographics, income groups, product categories, and channels. Using Excel (Pivot Tables, KPIs, and Dashboard design), the project delivers key insights that highlight customer behavior and campaign effectiveness.  

## 2. 🟥 Problem  
The company runs multiple marketing campaigns but struggles to:  
- Identify which age group and income segment responds best.  
- Understand which product categories drive the highest responses.  
- Compare customer purchase behavior across sales channels.  
- Measure the overall campaign effectiveness with clear KPIs.  

## 3. 🟨 Solution  
An interactive Excel dashboard was developed, supported by pivot tables and KPIs. It provides:  
- A snapshot of campaign performance (response rate, top customer segments, and top products).  
- Visualized comparisons of customer responses across age, income, and categories.  
- Channel-wise purchase analysis to evaluate buying patterns of responders vs non-responders.
